# ClientSAMS

This is only a proof of concept program that controls the browser to enter data from an Excel file into a large form.

## Introduction

Schools usually have large Excel sheets to store exam results of students. When creating report cards, the information has to be manually entered into the WebSAMS system because the Excel files are incompatible for import. This process is tedious and error-prone. ClientSAMS tries to alleviate this problem by controlling the browser to input the marks.
